# 100 Days of Code - Python

## Day 2 Project: Tip Calculator


### Requirements:

1. Create a Greeting
2. Ask what the total bill cost
3. What Percentage Tip would you like to give? 10, 12, 15, 20, 25
4. How many people to split the bill
5. Round output to two decimal places

### Possible Improvments:
1. Take The $ as user input, and still handle things correctly.
2. calculate and display what the tip value is.
3. calculate and display what the tip per person is.

ie:
```Welcome to the tip calculator.
What was the total bill? $124.56 (The $ is printed not user input)
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, 15, 20 or 25? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7
Each person should pay: $19.93
